See a live demo at neonmirrors.net.\nGet started with Clarity ","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/","section":"docs","title":"Overivew"},{"body":"Prerequisites Firstly, ensure you have installed the extended version of Hugo. See installation steps from Hugo's official docs.\nGetting up and running Read the prerequisites above and verify you're using the extended version of Hugo. There are at least two ways of quickly getting started with Hugo and the VMware Clarity theme:\nOption 1 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\n1hugo new site yourSiteName 2cd yourSiteName 3git init 4git submodule add https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity themes/hugo-clarity 5cp -a themes/hugo-clarity/exampleSite/* . Then run\n1hugo server Hurray!\nOption 2 (Great for testing quickly) You can run your site directly from the exampleSite. To do so, use the following commands:\n1git clone https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity 2cd hugo-clarity/exampleSite/ 3hugo server --themesDir ../.. Although, option 2 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes.\nOption 3 (The new, most fun \u0026amp; painless approach) This option enables you to load this theme as a hugo module. It arguably requires the least effort to run and maintain in your website.\nFirst things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n1git clone https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity.git clarity 2cd clarity/exampleSite/ 3hugo mod init my-site Open config.toml file in your code editor, replace theme = \u0026quot;hugo-clarity\u0026quot; with theme = [\u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;] or just theme = \u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;.\nHurray you can now run\n1hugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder. If unsure, learn how to update hugo modules\nThere is more you could do with hugo modules, but this will suffice for our use case here.\n","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/getting-started/","section":"docs","title":"Getting started"},{"body":" Blog with tagging and category options\nDeeplinks\nNative Image Lazy Loading\nCustomizable (see config)\nDark Mode (with UI controls for user preference setting)\nToggleable table of contents\nFlexible image configuration\nLogo alignment\nMobile support with configurable menu alignment\nSyntax Highlighting\nRich code block functions including:\nCopy to clipboard Toggle line wrap (dynamic) Toggle line numbers Language label Toggle block expansion/contraction (dynamic) To put it all in context, here is a preview showing all functionality.\n","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/features/","section":"docs","title":"Features"},{"body":"Configuration If set, jump over to the config.toml file and start configuring your site.\nThis section will mainly cover settings that are unique to this theme. If something is not covered here (or elsewhere in this file), there's a good chance it is covered in this Hugo docs page.\nGlobal Parameters These options set global values that some pages or all pages in the site use by default.\nParameter Value Type Overidable on Page author string no twitter string no largeTwitterCard boolean no ga_analytics string no description string yes introDescription string no numberOfTagsShown integer no fallBackOgImage file path (string) no codeMaxLines integer yes codeLineNumbers boolean yes mainSections array/string no centerLogo boolean no logo file path (string) no mobileNavigation string no figurePositionShow boolean yes figurePositionLabel string no customCSS array of file path (string) no customJS array of file path (string) no enforceLightMode boolean N/A enforceDarkMode boolean N/A titleSeparator string no comment boolean no Page Parameters These options can be set from a page frontmatter or via archetypes.\nParameter Value Type Overrides Global title string N/A date date N/A description string N/A draft boolean N/A featured boolean N/A tags array/string N/A categories array/string N/A toc boolean N/A thumbnail file path (string) N/A featureImage file path (string) N/A shareImage file path (string) N/A codeMaxLines integer yes codeLineNumbers boolean yes figurePositionShow boolean yes figurePositionLabel string no comment boolean no Modify links menu To add, remove, or reorganize top menu items, edit this YAML file. These menu items also display any categories (taxonomies) that might be configured for articles.\nSocial media To edit your social media profile links, edit this YAML file.\nIf you wish to globally use a large Twitter summary card when sharing posts, set the global parameter largeTwitterCard to true.\nSearch engine If using Google Analytics, configure the ga_analytics global parameter in your site with your ID.\nForcing light or dark mode By default, sites authored using Clarity will load in the browser with the user's system-wide settings. I.e., if the underlying OS is set to dark mode, the site will automatically load in dark mode. Regardless of the default mode, a UI control switch exists to override the theme mode at the user's discretion.\nIn order to override this behavior and force one mode or another, add either enforceLightMode or enforceDarkMode to your config.toml file. If neither value is present, add it.\nTo enforce Light Mode by default, turn enforceLightMode to true.\nTo enforce Dark Mode by default, turn enforceDarkMode to true\n1[params] 2... 3enforceLightMode = true # Force the site to always load in light mode. 4... Please note that you cannot enforce both modes at the same time. It wouldn't make sense, would it?\nPlease also note that the mode toggle UI will remain in place. That way, if a user prefers dark mode, they can have their way. The best of both worlds.\nI18N This theme supports Multilingual (i18n / internationalization / translations)\nThe exampleSite gives you some examples already. You may extend the multilingual functionality by following the official documentation.\nThings to consider in multilingual:\nsupported languages are configured in config/_default/languages.toml add new language support by creating a new file inside i18n directory. Check for missing translations using hugo server --i18n-warnings taxonomy names (tags, categories, etc...) are translated in i18n as well (translate the key) menus are translated manually in the config files config/_default/menus/menu.xx.toml menu's languages list are semi-hardcoded. You may chose another text for the menu entry with languageMenuName. Please, do better and create a PR for that. content must be translated individually. Read the official documentation for information on how to do it. Note: if you do NOT want any translations (thus removing the translations menu entry), then you must not have any translations. In the exampleSite that's as easy as removing the extra translations from the config/_default/... or executing this onliner:\n1sed \u0026#39;/^\\[pt]$/,$d\u0026#39; -i config/_default/languages.toml \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm config/_default/menus/menu.pt.toml Comments Clarity supports Hugo built-in Disqus partial, you can enable Disqus simply by setting disqusShortname in your configuration file.\ndisqusShortname should be placed in root level of configuration.\nYou can also create a file named layouts/partials/comments.html for customizing the comments, checkout Comments Alternatives for details.\n","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/customize/","section":"docs","title":"Customization"},{"body":"Images Image figure captions You have the option of adding captions to images in blog posts and automatically prepending a desired string such as \u0026quot;Figure N\u0026quot; to the alt text. This is controlled via two global settings.\nfigurePositionLabel is a string which will be prepended to any alt text of an article image. By default, this is set to \u0026quot;Figure.\u0026quot; And figurePositionShow controls, globally, whether to show this label. It does not affect whether to show the image alt text, only the prefix figure caption. For more granular control, figurePositionShow can be overridden at the article level if desired.\nThe number will be automatically calculated and assigned after the figurePositionLabel text starting from the top of the article and counting down. Featured images will be excluded from this figuration.\nImage figure captions example In this example, figurePositionLabel is set to \u0026quot;Figure\u0026quot; in config.toml and this is the first image in a given article.\n1![Antrea Kubernetes nodes prepared](./images/calrity/image-figure.png) Inline images To make a blog image inline, append :inline to its alt text. Typically, inline images will have no alt text associated with them.\nInline images example 1\u0026lt;!-- some image without alt text --\u0026gt; 2![:inline](someImageUrl) 3 4\u0026lt;!-- some image with alt text --\u0026gt; 5 6![some alt text:inline](someOtherImageUrl) Float images to the left To align a blog image to the left, append :left to its alt text. Article text will then flow to the right of the image.\nFloat images left example 1\u0026lt;!-- some image without alt text --\u0026gt; 2![:left](someImageUrl) 3 4\u0026lt;!-- some image with alt text --\u0026gt; 5 6![some alt text:left](someOtherImageUrl) Add classes to images To add a class image to the left, append ::\u0026lt;classname\u0026gt; to its alt text. You can also add multiple classes to an image separated by space. ::\u0026lt;classname1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;classname2\u0026gt;.\nImage class example 1\u0026lt;!-- some image without alt text --\u0026gt; 2![::img-medium](someImageUrl) 3 4\u0026lt;!-- some image with alt text --\u0026gt; 5 6![some alt text::img-large img-shadow](someOtherImageUrl) Article thumbnail image Blog articles can specify a thumbnail image which will be displayed to the left of the card on the home page. Thumbnails should be square (height:width ratio of 1:1) and a suggested dimension of 150 x 150 pixels. They will be specified using a frontmatter variable as follows:\n1... 2thumbnail: \u0026#34;images/2020-04/capv-overview/thumbnail.jpg\u0026#34; 3... The thumbnail image will take precedence on opengraph share tags if the shareImage parameter is not specified.\nArticle featured image Each article can specify an image that appears at the top of the content. When sharing the blog article on social media, if a thumnail is not specified, the featured image will be used as a fallback on opengraph share tags.\n1... 2featureImage: \u0026#34;images/2020-04/capv-overview/featured.jpg\u0026#34; 3... Share Image Sometimes, you want to explicitly set the image that will be used in the preview when you share an article on social media. You can do so in the front matter.\n1... 2shareImage = \u0026#34;images/theImageToBeUsedOnShare.png\u0026#34; 3... Note that if a share image is not specified, the order of precedence that will be used to determine which image applies is thumbnail =\u0026gt; featureImage =\u0026gt; fallbackOgImage. When sharing a link to the home page address of the site (as opposed to a specific article), the fallbackOgImage will be used.\nAlign logo You can left align or center your site's logo.\n1... 2centerLogo = true # Change to false to align left 3... If no logo is specified, the title of the site will appear in its place.\n","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/images/","section":"docs","title":"Manipulating Images"},{"body":"Blog directory Edit the config.toml file and change the blogDir key.

Number of tags example Table of contents Each article can optionally have a table of contents (TOC) generated for it based on top-level links. By configuring the toc parameter in the article frontmatter and setting it to true, a TOC will be generated only for that article. The TOC will then render under the featured image.\nTable of contents (TOC) example ","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/blogging/","section":"docs","title":"Blogging"},{"body":"Code Display line numbers Choose whether to display line numbers within a code block globally with the parameter codeLineNumbers setting to true or false.\n1[params] 2... 3codeLineNumbers = true # Shows line numbers for all code blocks globally. 4... Limit code block height You can globally control the number of lines which are displayed by default for your code blocks. Code which has the number of lines exceed this value will dynamically cause two code block expansion buttons to appear, allowing the user to expand to full length and contract. This is useful when sharing code or scripts with tens or hundreds of lines where you wish to control how many are displayed. Under params in config.toml file, add a value as follows:\n1[params] 2... 3codeMaxLines = 10 # Maximum number of lines to be shown by default across all articles. 4... If the value already exists, change it to the desired number. This will apply globally.\nIf you need more granular control, this parameter can be overridden at the blog article level. Add the same value to your article frontmatter as follows:\n1... 2codeMaxLines = 15 # Maximum number of lines to be shown in code blocks in this blog post. 3... If codeMaxLines is specified both in config.toml and in the article frontmatter, the value specified in the article frontmatter will apply to the given article. In the above example, the global default is 10 and yet the article value is 15 so code blocks in this article will auto-collapse after 15 lines.\nIf codeMaxLines is not specified anywhere, an internal default value of 100 will be assumed.\n","link":"https://omnigram.nexptr.com/en/docs/overview/syntax-highlighting/","section":"docs","title":"Syntax Highlighting"},{"body":"Custom CSS and JS To minimize HTTP requests per page, we would recommend loading CSS styles and JavaScript helpers in single bundles. That is to say, one CSS file and one JavaScript file. Using Hugo minify functions, these files will be minified to optimize the size.\nGoing by the above 👆🏻 reason, we recommend adding custom CSS and JS via the custom SASS file (Compose, Clarity) and the custom JS file (Compose, Clarity).\nHowever, sometimes you may need to load additional style or script files. In such cases, you can add custom .css and .js files by listing them in the config.toml file (see the snippet below).
